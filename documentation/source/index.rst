Superturtle
===========

This documentation explains how to use the functions provided
in the Superturtle package. Superturtle is distributed via pypi, 
so you can install it using pip or poetry. This package requires
`ImageMagick <https://imagemagick.org>`_. If you are using `mwc`, this should 
already be installed.

This documentation is organized according to a common pattern: the
:ref:`introduction` contains narrative documentation walking you through 
how to use the system. The :ref:`api` contains a complete description of 
each function and how to use it. If you're trying to learn what `Superturtle`
can do, start with the :ref:`introduction`. If you're trying to check a 
detail about how to do it, head to the :ref:`api`.

Superturtle is part of the `Making With Code` introductory computer science
curriculum, with an intended audience of beginners. If you are interested 
in `Making With Code`, or if you found `Superturtle` helpful, 
`Dr. Chris Proctor <https://chrisproctor.net>`_ would love to hear from you.
